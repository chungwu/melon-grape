	</p>
        <p>
          Mel and Chung went vacationing there in 2007 and loved it; the Kona coast has some of the finest white sand beaches intermingled with dark old lava flows.  And, of course, world-famous coffee!
        </p>
	<p>
	  <strong>The Ceremony</strong> will be held in the afternoon north of Kona.  Time and location TBD!
	</p>
	<p>
	  <strong>The Reception</strong> will be held at 6:00pm at a house along the Kohala Coast.  More details to come.

	<h3>Flight Info</h3>
	<p>
	  The closest airport to our wedding location is the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=12328814041328736567">Kona International Airport (KOA)</a>.  It is about a 30-minute drive from most hotels and about an hour from the reception venue.
	</p>
	<p>
	  For our guests, we have a <strong>special 7% discount from Alaska Airlines</strong> for traveling to Kona!  Simply use this coupon code while booking: <strong>ECMG535</strong>.  This code is only valid for travel between 6/3/2012 and 6/17/2012.  Alaska Airlines is a great choice because it has competitive rates, and has direct flights between Kona and San Jose, Oakland and Seattle.
	</p>

	<h3>Dress Code</h3>
	<p>
	  Dress code is resort-formal; casual but not sloppy.  Remember that the ceremony is going to be on a beach, with sand!  The weather will also likely to be hot and humid.  Guys should wear long-sleeve shirts and slacks or khakis; suits or jackets are not necessary.  Girls could wear sundresses, etc.
	</p>

	<h3>Hotel Info</h3>
	<p>
	  There are many hotels, from very affordable to unnecessarily luxurious, in and around Kona.
	</p>
	<p>
	  For those traveling in bigger groups, you may consider renting a vacation rental home instead!  You'll have a nicer and more comfortable place to stay, and it may end up being cheaper.  There are a lot of vacation rentals around Kona, but if you'd like to stay close to where Mel &amp; Chung are, look for listings on the <strong>Kohala Coast</strong> (on <a href="http://www.vrbo.com/vacation-rentals/usa/hawaii/big-island/kohala-coast">vrbo.com</a> or <a href="http://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rentals/hawaii/kohala-coast/r5615">homeaway.com</a>), which is slightly remote, but has a lot of rentals that are reasonably priced, with breathtaking views of the ocean.
	</p>

	<h3>Driving Info</h3>
	<p>
	  Renting a car on the Big Island is a necessity, as there is very little public transportation available.  But carpool as much as possible!
	</p>

	<h3>Duration of Stay</h3>
	<p>
	  Mel &amp; Chung will be arriving on 6/7/2012, and will be super busy preparing for the big event till 6/10/2012.  But after the wedding, they'll be up for hanging out!  Scuba diving, at the very least, is a certainty :-)  They will likely stay in Kona till 6/13, and will fly off to Taiwan after.  They recommend you spending a few days on the east coast of Big Island as well around Hilo, and check out the awesome Volcanoes National Park.  It's wetter, greener, and totally different there!

	<h3>How They Met</h3>
	<div class="polaroid right">
	  <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-IgAcMe9scWc/Twp0KnbsR7I/AAAAAAAABtI/bhylR6mOj5w/s400/story%2525205.jpg"/>
	</div>
	<div>
	<p>
Mel and Chung both went to UC Berkeley for college.  They met long before they started dating. 
	</p>
	<p>
The first time their paths crossed was on a night in September, 2004 at La Val's Subterranean Theater, a cramped, dark basement under the popular pizza parlor off of Euclid Ave that served as theater space for budding theater troupes.  It was Chung's idea, really; he loved the theater, and Julie, a close friend, was cajoled into going. For fear of total boredom, Julie decided to bring her roommate, Mel, along.  The play that night was <a href="http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2004-09-03/article/19566?headline=Fluffy-Bunnies-Titillate-in-La-Val-s-Basement-By-BETSY-M.-HUNTON---Special-to-the-Planet">Fluffy Bunnies in a Field of Daisies</a>, though in truth, neither Mel nor Chung remember much of the play, except for the uncomfortable chairs that they had to sit in. It was difficult at first for Mel to understand and share Chung's enthusiasm of the art form due to its underwhelming production values. Indeed, it was harder still for her to appreciate Chung, the quiet, reserved guy who barely spoke all night. 
	</p>
	<p>
Nevertheless, Mel managed to be slightly interested, by both the play and the person.  She tried to strike up a conversation with Chung on AIM (back when it was cool), but then made the mistake of asking for technical support for her computer.  Chung never replied back, and Mel vowed to never again speak to Julie's snobby friend.
	</p>
	<p>
In the fall of 2005, Mel and Chung's paths collided again when fate threw Mel and Chung's sister, Fu, together as roommates.  Chung had graduated by then and was working at Google, but he still went to Berkeley frequently to visit his sister.  It was then that Mel and Chung finally started getting to know each other.  They went to several more plays, including <a href="http://shotgunplayers.org/archive/seas13/travesties/trav.cfm">Travesties</a>, a play so confounding that Mel and Chung had an extended conversation about it into the wee hours of early morning.  Mel found Chung's take on the play strikingly similar to hers; she may one day call this conversation a turning point of sorts. These discussions continued afterwards on AIM (it was still cool) on everything and anything, and they never stopped talking to each other and sharing their experiences with each other ever since. 	  
	</p>
	</div>
	<h3>How He Proposed</h3>
	<div class="polaroid right">
	  <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zHKA6wNtJ34/TwpykfFoPhI/AAAAAAAABsk/c8UO4jMYB_g/s288/Jon%252520and%252520Mel%252520engagement%252520photos%252520054%252520copy.jpg"/>
	</div>
	<p>
Chung knew that Mel was expecting him to propose.  There was no way to surprise her, really, short of randomly whipping out a ring by the bus stop.  But if he couldn't surprise her, perhaps he could at least make it...  excruciatingly obvious?
	</p><p>
Chung picked October 19th, 2010 -- Mel's birthday -- as the day to propose, because Mel was likely already expecting something to happen.  Plus, it would conveniently combine two significant dates into one -- a real bonus!  He drove up to Mel's apartment in Berkeley at about 9:30pm, and dragged her into the car under the pretense of celebrating her birthday.
	</p><p>
He casually drove towards the Lawrence Hall of Science in the Berkeley hills -- a place they often visit for its breathtaking views -- but parked in an unfamiliar parking lot a little up the hill.  Unfamiliar to Mel, that is, but perfectly familiar to Chung; just two weekends prior, Sung, a former intern at the LHS, showed the little-known spot to Chung.  And just two days prior, Eddie and Chung had visited the spot at night to plan out all the necessary logistics.  Yes, Chung knew every inch of the place.
	</p>
	<div class="polaroid left">
	  <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-P3eVPUUAYus/Twpyrv9y8eI/AAAAAAAABss/EjIArrLTeF4/s288/engagement1%252520copy.jpg"/>
	</div>
	<p>
"What is this place?" Mel asked.
	</p><p>
"Oh, just some place Sung told me about.  Let's check it out!"
	</p><p>
"But it's really cold outside! Can we just stay in the car?"
	</p><p>
"NO!! WE MUST GO OUTSIDE!!  I BROUGHT YOU A BLANKET!!"
	</p><p>
Mel was starting to suspect that something was up.  Chung doesn't usually force her into the cold, even with a warm, blood-red microfiber blanket bought three days ago at Target.  Smelling a ring in her near future, she played along.
	</p><p>
Together, they walked up a series of steps zig-zagging along the Berkeley hills, which offered fantastic views of the cityscape completely covered up by the evening mist.  Slowly, they approached a bench along the path, and just as they were about to sit, a dozen candles surrounding the bench suddenly lit up
	</p>
	<div class="polaroid right">
	  <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kuraOBPXsvg/TwqGeDjeHEI/AAAAAAAABvU/DZj3aDPEnlk/s400/_MG_3811%252520copy.jpg"/>
	</div>
	<p>
The candles took some thought.  Originally, Chung had wanted to use white Christmas lights, but it was hard to find ones that ran on batteries.  By chance, he ran into some LED candles at Costco -- and, even better, they were remote-controlled!  Thus, as they walked up the path, Chung began frantically pressing the "on" button on the remote controller hidden in his pocket, powering the candles on one by one as they approached.  The surprise lights did not produce the effect Chung was looking for, though -- Mel just thought they were installed by park management, and had proximity sensors.
	</p><p>
They sat on the bench for a while, wrapped in a warm blanket, under the flickering glow of LED lights, admiring the rolling mists beneath them.  "Are you cold?" Chung asked.  Mel shook her head.  "Would you like some warm dessert?"  Mel turned, but before she could speak, Chung has reached under the bench and whipped out a folded bed-side table, purchased three days ago at Target.  He then pulled out a box of rose pedals, purchased that morning at Safeway, and sprinkled them all over the table.  As Mel's eyes widened in surprise, Chung then pulled out a thermal pot filled with red bean soup and sesame rice balls, which Chung heated up at Eddie's apartment two hours ago.  As he ladled the soup into bowls, Mel could only laugh at the absurdity.  "Where did those come from?!"
	</p><p>
As they finished the dessert, Chung asked if she wanted to see her birthday present.  Sensing the ring coming up, Mel eagerly agreed.  But when Chung reached under the bench again, what he pulled out was instead a book of limerick challenges, badly written by Chung himself, of the places that they've traveled to.  The pages are below:

When Mel finally got to the page with the ring embedded, Chung took out the ring, got on his knee, and asked Mel to marry him.  With teary eyes, she said yes.
	</p><p>
They celebrated with a bottle of wine hidden under the bench, donated by Chung's sister, Fu.  With a sudden jolt of realization, Mel asked, "You mean, you've been hiding the ring under this bench all this time, out in the open?!"  Actually, Chung had not.  Yes, he had come to this spot before picking up Mel, stashing away everything under the bench.  But he also had Fu with him, who hid behind the bushes and guarded the spot while Chung went to pick Mel up.  The ring was safe the whole time.  And, before Fu vanished into the night when she spotted them walking up the path, she also made sure to press the "record" button on a video camera hidden behind a tree, which Chung borrowed that morning from Haru.  Unfortuately, the quality of the recording was poor, and Mel is too embarrassed about it, so you don't get to see it :-)

Mel was born in Beijing, China. She was given the Chinese name “Mu (牧)”, which means shepherd or nomad, and the nomadic lifestyle for some reason had stuck with her. From early childhood, Mel has been moving from places to places, to different cities and countries. As a result, she loves traveling and exploring new environments. She briefly considered a career in Journalism, and worked as a travel writer for a year, but eventually decided that she would like to find something that will allow her to settle down and build a family together with Chung. Now she considers the Bay Area her true home. As she completes her advanced degree in Optometry, she will be joining the Air Force as an Optometrist next year and hopes to eventually find a more permanent job in the Bay Area.  She is looking forward to many more adventures with Chung in the future!

Chung was born in Taiwan, moved to Walnut for high school, went to Berkeley for college, worked at Google for five years, and today toils away at a startup that he co-founded.  Mel was the first and only girl that Chung dated, but he knew he hit the jackpot when Mel bought a collection of Ingmar Bergman DVDs for his birthday, and then actually proceeded to watch them with him, <em>without</em> turning them off half-way!  The cultural exchanges continued, with Radiohead, Imogen Heap, and many other things that Mel and Chung have learned to love together (or at least tolerate).  He is very excited to start the next chapter of his life with Mel, sure to be filled with more obscure films, plays and music, and also, does anyone actually read these bio blurbs?

I have known Melanie since my second year of college at Cal - we met over a shared love of homemade Chinese dumplings at a Chinese students group event (Thank you Ke for bringing me to that event!). At that moment, I knew we would become great friends, because after all, we both have great taste in food. One year later, we became roommates sharing a tiny studio together on top of La Val's Northside, and the tininess of the place made us closer friends (keep your minds out of the gutters, please). Mel is very kind and is always a great conversationalist. While we lived together, she always knew the right things to say when I was happy, or down, or just plain bored. We watched horror movies together (she made me...), worried about exams together, and laughed about guys together (I'm glad she didn't de-friend me after all my failed attempts at setting her up with my various friends…) Those were some of the best years of my life. In 2010, I got married, and Mel was my wonderful bridesmaid. Now, I am ecstatic to be able to 'return the favor'! I know Mel and Chung will be happily ever after, just like in those movies they love to watch together.

I am bound to one by blood, and bound to the other by roommateship.  I can’t say it was easy losing both a roommate and a brother at the same time when they first started dating, but I am definitely glad that they have found each other.  Chung and I have always been close growing up, from embarrassing our parents by acting immaturely in public to sharing similar interests, thoughts, and, of course, our quirky awkwardness and awkward quirkiness.  I guess it had to be someone of Mel’s intelligence and strong personality to connect with him intellectually and get him to open up.  Let’s be honest, not everyone could stand the quirk day after day, month after month, year after year.  But Mel managed to tolerate it, and even grew to love it.  She might deny this, but there is really no need to be embarrassed by it because the Wu quirky charm is quite irresistible.  I believe their love and dedication to each other will be able to conquer all, and they will create many precious memories together (gotta have the corny somewhere).  I could not be happier for them, and I wish them all the best.  I could be happier for myself though... because on top of getting Mel as a sister, I get to go to Hawaii to watch it all happen for realz =D

From what little is known of his true origins: Yang was born and
raised in the deadly arctic winter by a pack of polar wolves.  After
being discovered by a US military expeditionary force in 1989, he was
brought in as an experiment run by the CIA, trained to become an
efficient killing machine behind countless clandestine assassinations
of political and other critical targets.  The experiment soon proved
unstable, however, as one day in 2005 Yang's containment facility was
found destroyed and all key officials involved in the project were
murdered.  The trail went cold for many years, but domestic spies have
recently learned of Yang's cover as a programmer in a Silicon Valley
startup, and now government special forces are poised to terminate the
experiment and all of his connections.  The day has come that Yang has
been training for throughout his entire bloodstained life - the day he
must protect his new-found friends from being hunted by teams of
deadly CIA operatives - and he will stop at nothing until his new
mission is complete: to <strong>GET CHUNG WED</strong>.

Mel may not know this but I met her before she met me.  That may sound strange but as is common in life and our reality TV era, the famous are well known before they themselves realize it.  I had heard of Mel and her insanely smart self from friends before Mel, Angela and I decided to become roommates in a one bedroom apartment my last year of college.  The smallness of the space didn't engender conflict as much as it bred a close knit friendship and sisterhood.  Late into the night, after classes and homework, we would ruminate, muse, and talk for hours.  The topics ranged from the meaning of history, the evolution of species, and the cultural decline of societies to the fondest memories of our childhood, the poetry and music that moved us, and of course, the boys that made us laugh and cry.  It was in one of those conversations that Mel casually mentioned that she thought one of the boys in a photograph on my desk was, in her words, "quite handsome".  I'd be dishonest if I didn't say I was shocked when she pointed out that the boy was Jon - my high school friend Jon!  When I finally introduced these two at a play in the basement of La Val, well, the rest was history.  It would hardly be fair to give her away to anyone but an equally independently minded, intelligent, and loving person as Jon.  And I wish Mel and Jon happiness to the infinity!

Jon was one of the first people I met at Cal, and I have lived with Jon for way longer than is probably healthy.  We started as floormates on the fourth floor of Cleary Hall and ended up as roommates for the next three years.  Jon's quirkiness and eccentricities still sometimes baffle me after all these years and cannot be easily described by mere mortal words.  Fortunately, his love for foul smelling foods, nihilistic absurd plays, cacophonic music, Bergman and Allen, and uncontrolled spasmic body convulsions are mere distractions to the man that he truly is.  And it is equally fortunate that he has found someone who loves and appreciates him as he is.  Jon, you are the best landlord ever, and a great friend.  I wish you and Mel happiness to the infinity!

A number of happy coincidences have brought me to being a part of this bridal party. I knew Mel for almost six months without really knowing her. We met her first semester of Optometry school when I had the fortune of being a teaching assistant for one of her classes. At that point, she was just a name on a piece of paper and i wouldn't have been able to point her out of a crowd for the life of me. That summer, she was assigned (against her wishes, Mel will later admit) to do summer research in the lab I am a part of. That was when Mel went from being just a name to a friend who would later become a roommate and confidante. For as long as I've known them, Chung and Mel have come as two pieces of a whole. It is nearly impossible for me to think of one without the other and I am both privileged and honored to take part in their wedding.

	  Mel had the ambitious idea of creating a stop-motion video for their Save-The-Date.  She envisioned cool origami animations as pieces of paper fold themselves into paper cranes that, blown by paper windmills, make their way across the Pacific.  Once in Hawaii, there would be a beautiful sunrise as many paper cranes land and join together into a paper heart.  And maybe along the way, some sight gags like Angry Birds or Portal references could be inserted for comedic effect.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Unfortunately, when Mel described her idea to Chung, all he heard was that they would be making a cool stop-motion video about Portal!  Awesome!  The paper cranes part sounded a little weird, but he supposed that maybe they could shoot portals out of their mouths?  As Mel was busy studying for her optometry board exams, Chung went about shooting the video without much supervision.
	</p>
	<p>
	  600 pictures and several weekends later, the end result is the bizarre concoction of Portal and origami that you see below.  It was an absolute blast to make, and also an important lesson in couples communication.
