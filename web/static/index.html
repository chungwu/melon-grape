	</p>
	<p>
	  <strong>The Ceremony</strong> will be held at 3:30pm at <a href="#">Blah Beach</a> north of Kona, Hawaii on the Big Island.

	<h3>Flight Info</h3>
	<p>
	  The closest airport to our wedding location is the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=12328814041328736567">Kona International Airport (KOA)</a>.  It is about a 30-minute drive from most hotels and about an hour from the reception venue.
	</p>
	<p>
	  For our guests, we have a <strong>special 7% discount from Alaska Airlines</strong> for traveling to Kona!  Simply use this coupon code while booking: <strong>ECMG535</strong>.  This code is only valid for travel between 6/3/2012 and 6/17/2012.  Alaska Airlines is a great choice because it has competitive rates, and has direct flights between Kona and San Jose, Oakland and Seattle.
	</p>

	<h3>Dress Code</h3>
	<p>
	  Dress code is resort-formal; casual but not sloppy.  Guys should wear shirts and slacks, but suits or jackets are unnecessary.  Girls should WEAR WHAT???  Please remember that the weather will likely be hot and humid, so dress appropriately!  To illustrate the dress code, we've taken pictures of acceptable and unacceptable clothing:  [insert pix]
	</p>

	<h3>Hotel Info</h3>
	<p>
	  There are many hotels, from very affordable to unnecessarily luxurious, in and around Kona.
	</p>
	<p>
	  For those traveling in bigger groups, you may consider renting a vacation rental instead!  You'll have a nicer and more comfortable place to stay, and it may end up being cheaper.  There are a lot of vacation rentals around Kona, but if you'd like to stay close to where Mel & Chung are, look for listings on the <strong>Kohala Coast</strong> (on <a href="http://www.vrbo.com/vacation-rentals/usa/hawaii/big-island/kohala-coast">vrbo.com</a> or <a href="http://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rentals/hawaii/kohala-coast/r5615">homeaway.com</a>), which is slightly remote, but has a lot of rentals that are reasonably priced, with breathtaking views of the ocean.
	</p>

	<h3>Driving Info</h3>
	<p>
	  Renting a car on the Big Island is a necessity, as there is very little public transportation available.
	</p>

	<h3>Duration of Stay</h3>
	<p>
	  Mel & Chung will be arriving on 6/7/2012, and will be super busy preparing for the big event till 6/10/2012.  But after the wedding, they'll be up for hanging out!  Scuba diving, at the very least, is a certainty :-)  They will likely stay in Kona till 6/13, and will then drive over to the Hilo coast of Big Island and hang out there till 6/17/2012.

	<h3>How They Met</h3>
	<div class="polaroid right">

	<p>
Mel and Chung both went to UC Berkeley for college.  They met long before they started dating. 
	</p>
	<p>
The first time their paths crossed was on a night in September, 2004 at La Val's Subterranean Theater, a cramped, dark basement under the popular pizza parlor off of Euclid Ave that served as theater space for budding theater troupes.  It was Chung's idea, really; he loved the theater, and Julie, a close friend, was cajoled into going. For fear of total boredom, Julie decided to bring her roommate, Mel, along.  The play that night was <a href="http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2004-09-03/article/19566?headline=Fluffy-Bunnies-Titillate-in-La-Val-s-Basement-By-BETSY-M.-HUNTON---Special-to-the-Planet">Fluffy Bunnies in a Field of Daisies</a>, though in truth, neither Mel nor Chung remember much of the play, except for the uncomfortable chairs that they had to sit in. It was difficult at first for Mel to understand and share Chung's enthusiasm of the art form due to its underwhelming production values. Indeed, it was harder still for her to appreciate Chung, the quiet, reserved guy who barely spoke all night. 
	</p>
	<p>
Nevertheless, Mel managed to be slightly interested, by both the play and the person.  She tried to strike up a conversation with Chung on AIM (back when it was cool), but then made the mistake of asking for technical support for her computer.  Chung never replied back, and Mel vowed to never again speak to Julie's snobby friend.
	</p>
	<p>
In the fall of 2005, Mel and Chung's paths collided again when fate threw Mel and Chung's sister, Fu, together as roommates.  Chung had graduated by then and was working at Google, but he still went to Berkeley frequently to visit his sister.  It was then that Mel and Chung finally started getting to know each other.  They went to several more plays, including <a href="http://shotgunplayers.org/archive/seas13/travesties/trav.cfm">Travesties</a>, a play so confounding that Mel and Chung had an extended conversation about it into the wee hours of early morning.  Mel found Chung's take on the play strikingly similar to hers; she may one day call this conversation a turning point of sorts. These discussions continued afterwards on AIM (it was still cool) on everything and anything, and they never stopped talking to each other and sharing their experiences with each other ever since. 	  
	</p>
	</div>
	<h3>How He Proposed</h3>
	<div class="polaroid right">
	  <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-zHKA6wNtJ34/TwpykfFoPhI/AAAAAAAABsk/c8UO4jMYB_g/s288/Jon%252520and%252520Mel%252520engagement%252520photos%252520054%252520copy.jpg"/>
	</div>
	<p>
Chung knew that Mel was expecting him to propose.  There was no way to surprise her, really, short of randomly whipping out a ring by the bus stop.  But if he couldn't surprise her, perhaps he could at least make it...  excruciatingly obvious?
	</p><p>
Chung picked October 19th, 2010 -- Mel's birthday -- as the day to propose, because Mel was likely already expecting something to happen.  Plus, it would conveniently combine two significant dates into one -- a real bonus!  He drove up to Mel's apartment in Berkeley at about 9:30pm, and dragged her into the car under the pretense of celebrating her birthday.
	</p><p>
He casually drove towards the Lawrence Hall of Science in the Berkeley hills -- a place they often visit for its breathtaking views -- but parked in an unfamiliar parking lot a little up the hill.  Unfamiliar to Mel, that is, but perfectly familiar to Chung; just two weekends prior, Sung, a former intern at the LHS, showed the little-known spot to Chung.  And just two days prior, Eddie and Chung had visited the spot at night to plan out all the necessary logistics.  Yes, Chung knew every inch of the place.
	</p>
	<div class="polaroid left">
	  <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-P3eVPUUAYus/Twpyrv9y8eI/AAAAAAAABss/EjIArrLTeF4/s288/engagement1%252520copy.jpg"/>
	</div>
	<p>
"What is this place?" Mel asked.
	</p><p>
"Oh, just some place Sung told me about.  Let's check it out!"
	</p><p>
"But it's really cold outside! Can we just stay in the car?"
	</p><p>
"NO!! WE MUST GO OUTSIDE!!  I BROUGHT YOU A BLANKET!!"
	</p><p>
Mel was starting to suspect that something was up.  Chung doesn't usually force her into the cold, even with a warm, blood-red microfiber blanket bought three days ago at Target.  Smelling a ring in her near future, she played along.
	</p><p>
Together, they walked up a series of steps zig-zagging along the Berkeley hills, which offered fantastic views of the cityscape completely covered up by the evening mist.  Slowly, they approached a bench along the path, and just as they were about to sit, a dozen candles surrounding the bench suddenly lit up
	</p>
	<div class="polaroid right">
	  <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-kuraOBPXsvg/TwqGeDjeHEI/AAAAAAAABvU/DZj3aDPEnlk/s400/_MG_3811%252520copy.jpg"/>
	</div>
	<p>
The candles took some thought.  Originally, Chung had wanted to use white Christmas lights, but it was hard to find ones that ran on batteries.  By chance, he ran into some LED candles at Costco -- and, even better, they were remote-controlled.  Thus, they walked up the path, Chung began frantically pressing the "on" button on the remote controller hidden in his pocket, powering the candles on one by one as they approached.  The surprise lights did not produce the effect Chung was looking for, though -- Mel just thought they were installed by park management, and had proximity sensors.
	</p><p>
They sat on the bench for a while, wrapped in a warm blanket, under the flickering glow of LED lights, admiring the rolling mists beneath them.  "Are you cold?" Chung asked.  Mel shook her head.  "Would you like some warm dessert?"  Mel turned, but before she could speak, Chung has reached under the bench and whipped out a folded bed-side table, purchased three days ago at Target.  He then pulled out a box of rose pedals, purchased that morning at Safeway, and sprinkled them all over the table.  As Mel's eyes widened in surprise, Chung then pulled out a thermal pot filled with red bean soup and sesame rice balls, which Chung heated up at Eddie's apartment two hours ago.  As he ladled the soup into bowls, Mel could only laugh at the absurdity.  "Where did those come from?!"
	</p><p>
As they finished the dessert, Chung asked if she wanted to see her birthday present.  Sensing the ring coming up, Mel eagerly agreed.  But when Chung reached under the bench again, what he pulled out was instead a book of limerick challenges, badly written by Chung himself, of the places that they've traveled to.  The pages are below:

When Mel finally got to the page with the ring embedded, Chung took out the ring, got on his knee, and asked Mel to marry him.  With teary eyes, she said yes.
	</p><p>
They celebrated with a bottle of wine donated by Chung's sister, Fu, also hidden under the bench.  With a sudden jolt of realization, Mel asked, "You mean, you've been hiding the ring under this bench all this time, out in the open?!"  Actually, Chung had not.  Yes, he had come to this spot before picking up Mel, stashing away everything under the bench.  But he also had Fu with him, who hid behind the bushes and guarded the spot while Chung went to pick Mel up.  The ring was safe the whole time.  And, before Fu vanished into the night the moment she spotted them walking up the path, she also made sure to press the "record" button on a video camera hidden behind a tree, which Chung borrowed that morning from Haru.  Unfortuately, the quality of the recording was poor, but here's a highlight reel:

	  Mel had the ambitious idea of creating a stop-motion video for their Save-The-Date.  She envisioned cool origami animations as pieces of paper fold themselves into paper cranes that, blown by paper windmills, make their way across the Pacific.  Once in Hawaii, there would be a beautiful sunrise as many paper cranes land and join together into a paper heart.  And maybe along the way, they could insert some sight gags like Angry Birds or Portal references for comedic effect.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Unfortunately, when Mel described her idea to Chung, all he heard was that they would be making a cool stop-motion video about Portal.  He was very excited!  The paper cranes part sounded a little weird, but he supposed that maybe they could shoot portals out of their mouths?  As Mel was busy studying for her optometry board exams, Chung went about shooting the video without much supervision.
	</p>
	<p>
	  600 pictures and several weekends later, the end result is the bizarre concoction of Portal and origami that you see below.  It was an absolute blast to make, and also an important lesson in couples communication.
